The AXL token is the native cryptocurrency of the Axelar network, a decentralized blockchain interoperability platform designed to 
connect multiple blockchains, enabling seamless cross-chain communication and asset transfers. Staking AXL tokens involves locking 
them in the Axelar network to support its operations and security, in return for earning rewards.
